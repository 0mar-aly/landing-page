  # Landing Page Project


## Description

This project is a multi-section landing page, with an interactive navigation bar. The navigation bar is set to update according to the number of sections added.  
Furthermore, the section that is being viewed is highlighted. The navigation bar uses smooth scrolling to scroll to the linked section.  
  
  
## Dependencies
The page is built using HTML for the base content, CSS for styling the sections and the navigation bar, and JavaScript for the dynamic navigation functionality.  
The 3 files (_index.html, styles.css, app.js_) needed to run the page are all included in the ZIP file.   

## Usage
The page can be used as a starting template for a dynamic landing page. The stylesheet is basic yet unique. The JavaScript code can be reused in other applications as most of the logic is written as functions.

## Author  
The starter files were provided by **Udacity** as part of the Front End Web Development Nanodegree project. This includes the HTML file (first 3 sections), and most of the styling. The **JavaScript** functionality was added by me.
